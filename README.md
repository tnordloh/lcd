This project is an example of applying some of the techniques listed in 
Martin Fowler's book on refactoring.

It's based off of one of my first attempts to seriously master Ruby, by
solving the "lcd" ruby quiz at http://rubyquiz.com/quiz14.html.  

I took this freshman implementation, and refactored, recording each of the 
steps through many tiny commits.

I also got to put into practice a lot of what I've learned about proper
code formatting, building minitest test cases as I refactored (once I'd 
removed enough coupling to test small chunks of the program).  

I also got to add a Rakefile, to demonstrate some of what I've learned there 
as well.
